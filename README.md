This project expands how researchers explore Soviet propaganda and industrial documentation from the 1930s using English copies of USSR in Construction magazines, one of the Soviet Union's premier periodicals documenting the sociopolitical goals, values, and aesthetics of the Stalin era, as source material. The project involved generating comprehensive metadata for 45 recently digitized issues of USSR in Construction using both authority control and locally developed metadata vocabularies tailored to Soviet historical context.

At the heart of this project is an interactive network visualization that reveals connections between themes, geographic locations, and key figures within the magazines during Stalin's first and second Five Year Plans (1928-1932 and 1933-1937, respectively). This period was characterized by extremely ambitious agricultural collectivization and heavy industry development efforts. Users can explore how Soviet industrial narratives evolved, discover geographic patterns of development projects, and trace the relationships between significant political figures, cultures, and industries.

This mixed information science and digital humanities approach offers alternative archival frameworks for making these rare materials accessible to educators, students, and researchers for the first time in digital format. The magazines were digitized, color-corrected, and made digitally navigable as part of this collaborative project, making one of modern history's first and broadest propaganda campaigns newly visible and discoverable. Rather than only browsing individual magazine issues, users can identify thematic clusters, track temporal changes, and uncover cross-references that illuminate the broader story of Soviet industrialization, ideology, and representation.

The project expands digital access through the Wende Museum's digital collections portal while demonstrating emerging methodologies for analyzing historical periodicals through network analysis and additional visualizations.
