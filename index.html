								<div style="text-align: left;">
								<p>This project transforms how researchers explore Soviet propaganda and industrial documentation from the 1930s using English copies of <i></i>USSR in Construction</i> magazines, one of the Soviet Union's premier periodicals documenting the sociopolitical goals, values, and aesthetics of the Stalin era, as source material. The project involved generating comprehensive metadata for 45 recently digitized issues of <i>USSR in Construction</i> using both authority control and locally developed metadata vocabularies tailored to Soviet historical context. <br><br>
								At the heart of this project is an interactive network visualization that reveals connections between themes, geographic locations, and key figures within the magazines during Stalin's first and second Five Year Plans (1928-1932 and 1933-1937, respectively). This period was characterized by extremely ambitious agricultural collectivization and heavy industry development efforts. Users can explore how Soviet industrial narratives evolved, discover geographic patterns of development projects, and trace the relationships between significant political figures, cultures, and industries.<br><br>
								This mixed information science and digital humanities approach offers alternative archival frameworks for making these rare materials accessible to educators, students, and researchers for the first time in digital format. The magazines were digitized, color-corrected, and made digitally navigable as part of this collaborative project, making one of modern history's first and broadest propaganda campaigns newly visible and discoverable. Rather than only browsing individual magazine issues, users can identify thematic clusters, track temporal changes, and uncover cross-references that illuminate the broader story of Soviet industrialization, ideology, and representation.<br><br>
								The project expands digital access through the Wende Museum's digital collections portal while demonstrating emerging methodologies for analyzing historical periodicals through network analysis and additional visualizations.

									<p>This heatmap links themes to specific regions, but excluding Russia, to better highlight how the magazine used regional storytelling. For example, Kazakhstan is frequently tied to heavy industry, while Azerbaijan and Armenia appear tied to themes of collectivization and mining. </p>

									<br>
									<br>
									<p>This heatmap tracks the frequency of major themes across the magazine’s first five years. The consistent theme of “Labor & Workers” and “Heavy Industry” points to the central ideological commitments of the First and Second Five-Year Plans. Meanwhile, more intermittent themes such as “Aviation Technology” or “Children & Childcare” suggest shifting priorities or targeted campaigns. Visualizing the data this way reveals how <i>USSR in Construction</i> functioned as a flexible vehicle for reinforcing state goals.</p>

									<br>
									<br>
									<p>This bar chart highlights the most frequently referenced locations across the issues. While Russia appears most often, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Ukraine are not far behind. The magazine didn’t just report on infrastructure. It staged it across different regions to reinforce a sense of collective progress. This chart gives a sense of where the USSR chose to focus its narrative of development and modernity.</p>

I’m especially interested in archives shaped by power, where what gets preserved, emphasized, or left out reveals as much as what’s there. I was drawn to <i>USSR in Construction</i> because it was visually rich but largely inaccessible, and I wanted to build on my digitization work at the Wende Museum to create a researchable dataset that could trace shifts and connections in editorial focus over time.</p>

									</header><hr><p> My research focuses on how metadata design, data modeling, and digital tools can make historically difficult-to-access materials more findable and usable for research and education. With a background in visual art, I’m especially interested in how aesthetic movements reflect, and often serve, political agendas. I was drawn to <i>USSR in Construction</i> because of the aesthetic strategies used to promote socialist modernization, employing a visual rhetoric that rendered industrial progress both inevitable and desirable.  I aim to continue developing digital discovery tools that help users critically navigate cultural collections and understand how visual materials shape, and are shaped by, systems of power.</p>
